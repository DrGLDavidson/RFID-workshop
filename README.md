# RFID-workshop
This repository contains the R markdown tutorial for working with RFID data from computerised bird feeders. 


The tutorials can be found in the markdown folders in both pdf and htlm format. PDFs can be viewed directly on github and html files need to be downloaded and opened in a browser (this format is better). 
a Github Bookdown of these tutorials is in development.


The R markdown files with the raw R scripts and example data are in the other folders. 

Download the support files to your own working directory to follow along. 

Code suggestions/edits, and new workflows are welcome. Please feel free to collaborate.
